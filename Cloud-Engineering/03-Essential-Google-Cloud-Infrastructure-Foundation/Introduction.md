**Infrastructure** is the basic underlying framework of fundamental facilities and systems. Everything that goes into creating and supporting applications for the users is the infrastructure.

<h2>Googles compute services</h2>
<h3>Compute Engine</h3>

* Virtual machines on demand in the Cloud
* IaaS 
* maximum flexibility for those who prefer to manage server instances themselves.

<h3>Google Kubernetes Engine</h3>

* Containerized applications that Google manages for you
* A way to package code that is designed to be highly portable and use resources very efficiently. 
* Kubernetes orchestrates code in containers.

<h3>App Engine</h3>

* Fully managed PaaS
* Run code in the Cloud without having to worry about infrastructure

<h3>Cloud Functions</h3>

* Serverless execution environment
* Functions as a Service
* Executes your code in response to events

<h3>Cloud Run</h3>

* Managed compute platform running stateless containers via web requests or Pub/Sub events
* Serverless
* Built on Knative giving freedom to move workloads across different environments and platforms, fully managed on Google Cloud
* Is fast, as it can scale up and down almost instantaneously and only charged for what you use
